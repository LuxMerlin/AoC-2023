# AoC-2023
Advent of Code 2023 repo

This is my repo for Advent of Code 2023, hopefully but the end of it it will have all 24 or 25 puzzels solved.

I am going to be using Rust again this year, mainly as i find it to be a great language to work in and i want to learn more about it

Project layout
- Each day will have a new folder
- Each part will have a subfolder


I will be trying to keep notes on what i leard from each puzzel as well, and if i skip one i will be making a doc as to why
